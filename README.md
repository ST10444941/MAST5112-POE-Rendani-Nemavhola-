In HomeScreen.js I added a button that allows the chef to add new dishes to the menu by navigating them to the “Add menu” screen, where the chef can add the necessary details for the dish they want to add. I also added a manage menu screen on which the chef can edit the menu by either adding or removing items. The filter menu, is intended to allow the user to only view certain items within the menu.
